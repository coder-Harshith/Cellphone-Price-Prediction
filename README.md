# üì± Cellphone Price Prediction

## üß† Project Objective

The goal of this project is to predict the **price range** (Low, Medium, High, Very High) of mobile phones using their **technical specifications**. Instead of predicting an exact price, this classification model helps businesses understand where their product might fall in the pricing spectrum, enabling more informed product strategy and market positioning.

## üìà Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing

* Handled missing/null values (if any)
* Checked data types and performed encoding (if needed)
* Feature scaling (StandardScaler)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Visualized correlations between features and target
* Analyzed distribution of price ranges
* Checked influence of RAM, battery, and connectivity features on price

### 3. Model Building

* Applied classification algorithms:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest Classifier
  * Support Vector Machine
  * Decision Tree
  * XGBoost

### 4. Model Evaluation

* Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
* Cross-validation for reliable performance measurement
* Visualized confusion matrix and ROC curves (if applicable)

### 5. Feature Importance

* Identified key contributors to price prediction using tree-based models
* RAM, Battery, and Resolution were highly influential
